# Domain Focus/Problem Statement
The focus of this project is to design a Python program that will allow users 
to input, process and review their financial transactions in a structured and 
meaningful way.

People often struggle with keeping track of their financial decisions and where 
exactly their money is going, things such as subscriptions and small bills 
can add up without them realizing.

We plan to help people struggling to answer questions like “Where is my money 
going each month?” or “Am I overspending on subscriptions?”
# Installation/Setup Instructions
# Usage Examples for Key Functions 
There are 5 key functions that will help with the organization and UI data throughout the entire program.

The first key function is Data Validation, making sure that balances make sense, date formats are correct, 
and verifying that a category is from an allowed list. 

The second key function is Data Cleaning, and making sure that there are no
duplicates and that all dates are converted into a consistent format. 

The third key function is Data Transformation, which allows the total sum of transactions from an account, identify subscriptions, and create period summaries weekly or monthly.

The fourth key function is Analysis, which filters transactions by period and calculates the average spending per month.

The fifth key function is Storage/Reporting, which saves transactions to either a JSON or CSV file. It can also create
a readable summary, essentially a bank statement.
# Function Libary Overview/Organization
# Contribution Guidelines for Team Members
Together team members identified the scope of the project and dicscussed the key
functions that the project would accomplish.

Once these functions were identified, members divided theses functions among 
themselves:
- Uzzam: Data Validation 
- Kevin: Data Cleaning
- Angelo: Data Transformation
- Keven: Data Analysis/Storage

Each member created 4-5 functions in their respective categories with some 
collaboration occuring if help was needed.

All members were expected to have their portion of the project completed by
Saturday night (October 11th).
